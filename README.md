# Chat-Application
Project Description:
Implemented a chat application in Java that allows users to register, log in, create/join chat rooms, and interact within rooms. The application utilized object-oriented programming principles to manage user accounts, handle room interactions, and provide a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Utilized a database to store user information securely. Users could register accounts with unique usernames and passwords.

User Interface: Created interactive text-based user interfaces for various application stages, such as registration, login, room interaction, and command handling.

Chat Room Interaction: Users could join existing chat rooms or create new ones. Within chat rooms, users could send messages, list participants, and view message history.

Command Handling: Implemented a command system that recognized specific commands (e.g., /help, /list, /history) and executed corresponding actions within the chat room.

Database Integration: Utilized JDBC for database connectivity to manage user accounts and room interactions, enabling secure storage and retrieval of user information.

Implementation Highlights:

Created separate classes for different views, including InitialView for registration and login, MainView for room selection and account management, and RoomView for room interactions.

Incorporated loops to continuously prompt users for input and respond dynamically based on their choices.

Designed a character-based user interface that guided users through different stages of the chat application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Skills Utilized:

Java Programming: Developed the entire chat application in Java, employing object-oriented programming concepts and language features.

Database Connectivity: Utilized Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and manage user account information.

User Interface Design: Designed interactive text-based interfaces using standard input/output, guiding users through registration, login, and chat room interactions.

Outcome and Conclusion:

Successfully developed a functional chat application that enables users to interact within chat rooms while ensuring secure user authentication. The project demonstrated proficiency in Java programming, database integration, and user interface design. The application provides a basis for real-time communication and collaboration, showcasing practical programming skills in a networking context.
